    "content": "Now referred to as theIPO capital of India, Delhi has it all - top-tier educational institutes, robust public transportation infrastructure, commercial real estate at competitive rates, and a thriving startup ecosystem.\nThis city has something for everyone. You donât have to be a B2B SaaS or Fintech founder to find your feet in business here. Whether you want to start an art house or a small-scale business, Delhi has equally enough opportunities for you to thrive and grow. Here, the ideas transcend district boundaries and spread across Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon and more.\nAnd, as a result, Delhi-NCR has been able to make a dent in the startup ecosystem.\nUnfortunately, safety remains a prime concern in Delhi. Additionally, the tech parks are quite far from Delhi, mostly located in Noida and Gurgaon. But all said and done, it still is a great city to live in. A step into this city andDilwalon ki Dilliwill wrap you in its arms and never leave you alone. Itâs more than just bricks and buildings, itâs a community, a family. As itâs said,ye sheher nahi mehfil hai.\nð¡Hereâs a list of the top co-working spaces in Delhi-NCR.We filtered this list based on Google reviews and chose the ones rated 4.2 â­ and above. Best if youâre a lean team, building up from scratch.âP.S. The following prices are an average and not the exact quote you might receive from vendors. This is a disclaimer that there could be price discrepancies depending on the location you choose and demand vs supply.\nð¡Ideal to invest in working out of a tech park if youâve crossed 300+ employees in scale. It also becomes cost-effective when compared to co-working spaces.",
