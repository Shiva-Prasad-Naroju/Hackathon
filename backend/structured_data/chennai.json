We got you covered.\nIf you'd like to learn more about Plum and what we're up to,follow this link.\nThereâs an interesting excerpt from the time Girish Mathrubootham was building Freshworks.\nMany Chennai entrepreneurs shift their base to Bengaluru once their startups reach a certain size. In 2011, G also contemplated shifting his base to Bengaluru. He went to the city, finalised an office space for his startup, and explored residence options. Then hurdles came. His employees didnât want to relocate to Bangalore. Finding good schooling for his children also proved challenging.âIt was as if the universe was conspiring to keep me in Chennai,âhe said in an interview with Economic Times. And just like that, in the spur of the moment, G decided to build Freshworks from Chennai.\nWith the rise of Zoho alongside Freshworks, the city has gained a reputation for being a SaaS hotbed. Zinnov forecasts that Chennai could see the emergence of seven more unicorns in the next five years, including Uniphore, Mad Street Den, and Crayon Data.",

    "content": "On an aside, Chennai is also considered a more liveable city. It is relatively safer, has shorter commutes, better traffic conditions, relatively lower cost of living, and lower air pollution. Unfortunately, the city moves slowly in the fast-paced startup world. For the young crowd, there are cultural challenges like the lack of vibrant nightlife. But all said and done, this is great city to live in. If youâre planning a move to Chennai or youâre already here, we hope this guide helps.\nð¡Hereâs a list of 16 top co-working spaces in Chennai.We filtered this list based on Google reviews and chose the ones rated 4.2 â­ and above.\nBest if youâre a lean team, building up from scratch.\nâP.S. The following prices are an average and not the exact quote you might receive from vendors. This is a disclaimer that there could be price discrepancies depending on the location you choose and demand vs supply.\nð¡ Ideal to invest in working out of a tech park if youâve crossed 300+ employees in scale.\nIt also becomes cost-effective when compared to co-working spaces.Please note that the popularity and rankings of IT parks may vary over time and there may be other emerging IT parks in Chennai as well.",
