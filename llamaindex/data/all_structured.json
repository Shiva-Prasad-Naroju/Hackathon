In 2011, G also contemplated shifting his base to Bengaluru. He went to the city, finalised an office space for his startup, and explored residence options. Then hurdles came. His employees didnât want to relocate to Bangalore. Finding good schooling for his children also proved challenging.âIt was as if the universe was conspiring to keep me in Chennai,âhe said in an interview with Economic Times. And just like that, in the spur of the moment, G decided to build Freshworks from Chennai.\nWith the rise of Zoho alongside Freshworks, the city has gained a reputation for being a SaaS hotbed.

You donât have to be a B2B SaaS or Fintech founder to find your feet in business here. Whether you want to start an art house or a small-scale business, Delhi has equally enough opportunities for you to thrive and grow. Here, the ideas transcend district boundaries and spread across Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon and more.\nAnd, as a result, Delhi-NCR has been able to make a dent in the startup ecosystem.\nUnfortunately, safety remains a prime concern in Delhi. Additionally, the tech parks are quite far from Delhi, mostly located in Noida and Gurgaon. But all said and done, it still is a great city to live in. A step into this city andDilwalon ki Dilliwill wrap you in its arms and never leave you alone. Itâs more than just bricks and buildings, itâs a community, a family. As itâs said,ye sheher nahi mehfil hai.\nð¡Hereâs a list of the top co-working spaces in Delhi-NCR.We filtered this list based on Google reviews and chose the ones rated 4.2 â­ and above. Best if youâre a lean team, building up from scratch.âP.S. The following prices are an average and not the exact quote you might receive from vendors. This is a disclaimer that there could be price discrepancies depending on the location you choose and demand vs supply.\nð¡Ideal to invest in working out of a tech park if youâve crossed 300+ employees in scale. It also becomes cost-effective when compared to co-working spaces.",
